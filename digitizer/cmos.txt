CMOS (mostly SPI) subsystem
  All driven via level converters from P2, where P2_VADJ is used
  on 74LVC8T245 or 74AVC4T245 CMOS level converter chips.
  Note that 74AVC4T245 chips' control pins are referenced to VCC(A).

All signalling directions listed from the perspective of the peripheral
  chip on this board, not the FPGA.

BMB7 compatibility note:
  "TOP" FMC is LPC, connected to HR Kintex banks 13 and 14
  "BOTTOM" FMC is HPC, LPC subset connected to HP Kintex banks 32 and 34
  Top and bottom as drawn with optical links to the left, FMC to the right,
  opposite from SLAC's drawings of fmc_carrier_c00 that have FMC to the left.
